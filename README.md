# NodeJS encryption and decryption application based on fs and stream module.

## This is application demonstrates the how encryption and decryption applied by using NodeJS fs and stream module. Encryption is done by allocating 8 bytes to buffer and adding 1 to it (255 + 1) for the simplicity and Decryption other way around by removing 1 from buffer of encrypted text.

## Installation

    # Download or clone repository
    # NodeJS is required to run the application.
    # Update read.txt with the text you would like to encrypt.

## commands to run the application

    # CD into the directory and run the below commands one by one
    # run node encryption.js ( this command will encrypt the text from read.txt and create a new file write.txt with encrypted text)
    # run node decryption.js (this command will decrypt the text from write.txt and create a file decrypted.txt with original text.)

## Attached are read.txt, write.txt and decrypted.txt for the demo purpose.
